                    <h2>Custom Machines: Machine Recipes</h2>
                    <p>Now that you've set up one machine or multiple with potential input/output options for items/fluids/energy, 
                        you can now define recipes for those machines that the machine will then perform if the input items/fluids/energy necessary are present and space for output items/fluids/energy is available.</p>
                    <p>This system allows for any kind of potential recipes you might want the machine to perform. 
                        This can range from some sort of furnace that takes items and produces a set amount of 'energy' per tick, 
                        up to something like a Fusion Reactor that takes several fluids as input and outputs another fluid and a lot of energy per tick. 
                        It can also centrifuge items out of fluids for the cost of a set amount of energy per tick and so on and so forth. 
                        There is no bounds to this kind of definition.</p>
                    <p>However, there are certain things that have to be set so the recipe can function properly. 
                        Let's first look at the format and then at a few examples:</p>
                    <div class="codesection">
                        <p>
                            {

                                //This is defined in the machine's json as 'registryname'

                                //That way the mod can safely read and write
                                //recipes from NBT.

                                    {

                                        //This also can have a chance tag
                                        //to define the chance that the fluid

                                    }
                                ]
                            }
                        </p>
                    </div>
                    <p>This defines a recipe for the 'centrifuge' which runs for 20 ticks - so 1 second ideally - uses up 10 'energy' per tick, 
                        so a total of 200 'energy' (RF, FE, ...), uses up 10mB of lava with a chance of 80% to produce a gold nugget with a chance of 1% or a fire charge with the chance of 20%.</p>
                    <p>Also: instead of defining only 1 machine in 'machine' you can also define an array of machines in 'machine' and the recipe will be added to all of those machines. Example:</p>
                    <div class="codesection">
                        <p>
                            "machine": [
                                "centrifuge",
                                "some_other_machine",
                                "another_machine"
                            ]   
                        </p>
                    </div>
                </div>
