                <div class="col">
                    <p>You might want to add a recipe for a machine that (for example) take 1 coal + energy and output 1 iron. 
                        Now you want to "reward" the user for providing lava as fluid input and you define 1 coal + 1 bucket of lava + energy outputs 4 iron.</p>
                    <p>The problem arises that if the user provides coal + lava + energy, 
                        the machine checks the recipe that takes 1 coal + energy => 1 iron first and it of course all input components of that are present & useable, 
                        so it'll select that recipe and produce 1 iron instead of consuming the additional lava and produce 3 more iron of that piece of coal.</p>
                    <p>By default, the mod will sort recipes by the amount & type of input-components needed. 
                        So for example a recipe-selection failure like the one explained above would not even happen by default, 
                        however you can still run into this problem occasionally.</p>
                    <p>Now how to prevent this? Defining a priority for these kinds of recipes. 
                        That way you can give the mod a hint which recipes to select/check first and which afterwards. 
                        Higher priorities get checked first, lower priorities afterwards. 
                        (The order at which the mod checks the recipes is identical to the order they show up in JEI!)</p>
                    <p>Example:</p>  
                    <div class="code">
                        <pre class="code">
[...]
"machine": "...",
"registryName": "...",
"recipeTime": 20,
"priority": 2,
"requirements": [
[...]</pre>
                    </div>
                    <p>As shown in the example, 
                        the sorting-priority can be defined as integer-number in 'priority'. 
                        The priority definition is optional. If no priority is defined, 
                        the priority is 0.</p>
