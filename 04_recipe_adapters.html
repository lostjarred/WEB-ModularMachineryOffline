                    <p>While writing up new machines and recipes is fine and all, 
                        you might want to import recipes from furnaces or related - That's what adapters are for. 
                        They convert recipes from given/defined recipes/machines and convert them over into a format ModularMachinery understands and adds them to the recipe pool of a given machine.</p>
                    <p>At the moment, adapters are still pretty primitive and non-customizable, but that's going to change. (at least i have plans for that...)</p>
                    <p>Currently available adapters:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>(v1.0+)"<span class="bold">minecraft:furnace</span>" (Will convert all furnace recipes into ModularMachinery recipes, duration 120 ticks at 20 FE/t)</li>
                        <li>(v1.9.6+) <span class="bold">Every defined machine</span> (its registry name) can be specified as adapter, 
                            so you can import recipes from one machine into another (Recipes will be identical unless modified by recipe modifiers, 
                            explained down below). Machines created with modular machinery jsons will always be in the 'modularmachinery' namespace.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>The syntax for the moment (v. 1.0) is as follows:</p>
                    <div class="code">
                        <pre class="code">{
    "machine": "machineregistryname",
    "adapter": "minecraft:furnace"
}</pre>
                    </div>
                    <p class="border border-bottom">Adapters must be defined in the same directory as recipes and have to have a file ending of <span class="bold">.adapter.json</span> !</p>
                    <p>From version 1.9.6 and newer versions, modifiers can be applied to each recipe imported through the adapter. 
                        This can - as explained in <a href="012_recipe_modifiers.html">13. Recipe Modifiers [Advanced]</a> - modify all potential requirements of a recipe, e.g. energy, item, duration, ...</p>
                        <div class="code">
                            <pre class="code">{
    "machine": "alloy_furnace",
    "adapter": "minecraft:furnace",
    "modifiers": [
        {
            "io": "output",
            "target": "item",
            "operation": 1,
            "multiplier": 2.0
        },
        {
            "io": "input",
            "target": "duration",
            "operation": 1,
            "multiplier": 0.5
        }
    ]
}</pre>
                    </div>
                    <p>In this example of an adapter.json, 
                        the adapter imports all recipes from 'minecraft:furnace' and will modify them so they will produce double the output (operation 1 = multiply; multiplier 2 = result amount * 2).</p>
                    <p>So one can optionally specify a "modifiers" tag in the .adapter.json, which is required to be a list/array of modifier objects. See the wiki page for recipe modifiers for further information.</p>
